# Compiler course code sniptes
This repository contains several code snippets that  I develop to teach the ANTLR compiler generator at Iran University of Science and Technology (UST). Grammars have been written in ANTRL v4 format. For each grammar, the source code of Lexer and Parser is available in Python 3.x. 
The repository is assumed to be updated regularly.
